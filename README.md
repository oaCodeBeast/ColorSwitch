# ColorSwitch
Just a quick little way to implement color switching on your site. It's pretty modular. You can customize it easily to do what you want it to. You could have it cycle between 2 colors or cycle through 12. You could have it not cycle at all and have the event of color switching only take place upon a certain button click. 

Download the index.html, ColorSwapScript, style.css and get some jQuery and jQuery ui to get a working demo of this. You can play around with it there and get a feel for it. 

You will need to download both jQuery and jQuery ui for this to work.
